# Jamb :game_die:

Jamb is a classy game but on the web

Take a look: [Coming soon](#)

## General info

I tried to create an online version of the Jamb board game. The main goal of this project was to practice and master the use of the redux-toolkit. Of course, the site is fully functional and responsive. For now, a basic version is available where you can only play with yourself, but I plan to change that soon :grin:
